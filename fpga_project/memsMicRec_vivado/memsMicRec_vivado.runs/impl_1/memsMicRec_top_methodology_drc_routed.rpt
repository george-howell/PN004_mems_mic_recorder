2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock clocking_comp/mmcm_clocks/inst/SYSCLK is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks CLK_OUT1_mmcm_clock and sys_clk_pin are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks CLK_OUT1_mmcm_clock] -to [get_clocks sys_clk_pin]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk_pin and CLK_OUT1_mmcm_clock are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sys_clk_pin] -to [get_clocks CLK_OUT1_mmcm_clock]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks CLK_OUT1_mmcm_clock and sys_clk_pin are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks CLK_OUT1_mmcm_clock] -to [get_clocks sys_clk_pin]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Critical Warning

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock clocking_comp/mmcm_clocks/inst/SYSCLK is created on an inappropriate internal pin clocking_comp/mmcm_clocks/inst/SYSCLK. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
