WARNING: [Opt 31-35] Removing redundant IBUF, clocking_comp/mmcm_clocks/inst/clkin1_ibufg, from the path connected to top-level port: CLK 
Resolution: The tool has removed redundant IBUF. To resolve this warning, check for redundant IBUF in the input design.
WARNING: [Constraints 18-550] Could not create 'IBUF_LOW_PWR' constraint because net 'clocking_comp/mmcm_clocks/SYSCLK' is not directly connected to top level port. Synthesis is ignored for IBUF_LOW_PWR but preserved for implementation.

If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
WARNING: [DRC DPOP-2] MREG Output pipelining: DSP hpFlt_comp/bq1_4/multiVec_reg[0]0 multiplier stage hpFlt_comp/bq1_4/multiVec_reg[0]0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.
